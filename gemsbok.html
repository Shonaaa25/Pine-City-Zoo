                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to arid regions of Southern Africa. 
    Known for its long, straight horns and striking black-and-white facial markings, the gemsbok is 
    well-adapted to survive in desert and semi-desert environments like the Kalahari. Both males and 
    females have horns, which can grow up to 85 cm long, making them excellent for defense.</p>

    <p>Gemsbok are herbivores and primarily graze on grasses, herbs, and shrubs. They can survive for 
    long periods without water by extracting moisture from their food and by regulating their body 
    temperature during the heat of the day. Their beige-colored coats reflect sunlight, helping them 
    stay cool in hot climates.</p>

    <p>These majestic animals are social and typically found in small herds, although solitary males 
    are also common. Their bold appearance and graceful movements make them one of the most iconic 
    animals in southern African reserves and parks.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok in pen A14, near the desert biome exhibit.</p>
