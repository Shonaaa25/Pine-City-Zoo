                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest living land animal, known for its exceptionally 
    long neck and legs. Native to savannahs and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, giraffes use 
    their height to browse leaves and buds from tall trees, particularly acacias. Males can grow up to 
    5.5 meters tall, while females are slightly shorter.</p>

    <p>Giraffes have distinctive coat patterns made up of brown patches separated by lighter lines. These 
    patterns are unique to each individual and also help with camouflage. Despite their long necks, 
    giraffes have the same number of vertebrae in their necks as humans—seven—but each one is much longer.</p>

    <p>They are social animals, often found in loose herds. Their long necks also play a role in dominance 
    battles among males, known as "necking." Giraffes have large eyes positioned on the sides of their 
    heads for wide vision, and their long tongues (up to 45 cm) help them grasp food easily.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen B07, close to the acacia grove near the main viewing platform.</p>
